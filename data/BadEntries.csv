The mariner community needs enhanced characterizations of environmental uncertainty now, but the accuracy of the characterizations is still not sufficient enough and therefore formal user evaluations cannot take place at this point in development. We received feedback on the applicability of our techniques from domain experts. We used this in conjunction with previous results to compile a set of development guidelines (some obvious, others not)

orting life. Do not extinguish that element, do not corrupt it, learn that it is divine; and do not substitute wretched scholastic feuds for the voice of nature.&quot; ---Essay on Tolerance, Voltaire (1763).  We do not live very long. By the time a man has lived 20 years, he may have begun to learn some of what was done in previous centuries. By the time a man has lived 30 years, he may have begun to do something himself, which was not done before. Yet by the time a man has lived 40 years, he begins to doubt whether any of what was done before, including his own work, is of any real value!  If we lived much longer, say for 100 or 200 years in good health, some people would continue to learn and think and do original things all through their lifetimes. Those long-lived men and women would then go far beyond us in their thinking and knowledge. Indeed, the simple-minded ideas which we follow in our philosophy and science and religion today, might look meager and infantile to such superior bein

This paper examines the use of proxies (or reference variables) for the true factors in the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). It generalises the work of Reisman(1992) and Shanken(1992) and shows that, when there are more reference variables than the true factors, the APT still holds. The possibility of fewer reference variables than the true factors is also considered, but the APT is not shown to hold, in the same sense, for this case. This work builds on an earlier paper by Ingersoll(1984), and our propositions can be thought of as specialisations of his Theorems 1 and 6. Our work does not use the mathematics of Hilbert and Banach spaces (as used by Reisman(1992)) and, thus, is open to a much wider audience. Deriving the APT when the Number of Factors is Unknown 1

www.socsci.auc.dk/~thomas ph. +(45)96358169 In social and labour market policy a cross-cutting theme for the activities of the Danish presidency of the European Union (autumn 2002) is framed: “Inclusiveness- by social dialogue and partnership”. The vision of an inclusive labour market (ILM) was invented by the Danish ministry of Social Affairs in 1994 and has won general acceptance by all political parties as well as social partners, NGOs and the business community alike. The aim of the campaign and its various political and social initiatives has been, on the one hand, to reduce the risks of exclusion from ordinary employment (prevention and retention) and, on the other hand, to increase the labour market participation of the already marginalised (social integration). A major focus of the campaign has been to promote Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This ‘Danish model of inclusiveness ’ is now held up in front of European policy-makers, administrators, social partners, NGOs, enterprise leaders etc. All of them presumably asking the question: What can we learn from Denmark?

A major challenge in gene expression analysis is e#ective  data organization and visualization. One of the most popular tools for  this task is hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering allows a user  to view relationships in scales ranging from single genes to large sets of  genes, while at the same time providing a global view of the expression  data. However, hierarchical clustering is very sensitive to noise, it usually  lacks of a method to actually identify distinct clusters, and produces a  large number of possible leaf orderings of the hierarchical clustering tree.

Program slicing is a technique for visualizing dependences and restricting attention to just the  components of a program relevant to evaluation of certain expressions. Backward slicing reveals which  other parts of the program the expressions&apos; meaning depends on, while forward slicing determines  which parts of the program depend on their meaning. Slicing helps programmers understand program  structure, which aids program understanding, maintenance, testing, and debugging; slicing can also  assist parallelization, integration and comparison of program versions, and other tasks.

Mining frequent patterns from large databases plays an essential role in many data mining tasks and has broad applications. Most of the previously proposed methods adopt apriorilike candidate-generation-and-test approaches. However, those methods may encounter serious challenges when mining datasets with prolific patterns and/or long patterns. In this

Various  Prototype Reduction Schemes (PRS) have been reported in the literature. Based on their operating  characteristics, these schemes fall into two  fairly distinct categories -- those which are of a creative sort, and  those which are  essentially  selective. he norms for evaluating these methods are typically , the reduction rate and the classification  accuracy. It is  generally  believed that the former class of methods is superior to the latter. In this
Feature reduction is often an essential part of solving a classification  task. One common approach for doing this, is Principal Component  Analysis. There the low variance directions in the data are removed  and the high variance directions are retained. It is hoped that  these high variance directions contain information about the class differences. For one-class

In this paper we study several variants on problems related to the Erdős-Szekeres Theorem about subsets of S in convex position, when additional chromatic constraints are considered.
Software maintenance, program analysis and transformation tools almost always rely on static source code analysis as the first and fundamental step to gather information. In the past, two different strategies have been adopted to develop tool suites. There are tools encompassing or implementing the source parse step, where the parser is internal to the toolkit, developed and maintained with it. A different approach builds tools on the top of external, already available, components such as compilers that output the abstract syntax tree, or make it available via an API. This paper
Fail-stop cryptographic protocols are characterized by the property that they terminate when an active attack is detected, rather than releasing information valuable to the attacker. Since such a construction forces attacks (other than denial-of-service) to be passive, the protocol designer&apos;s concerns can be restricted to passive attacks and malicious insiders. A significant advantage of such protocols is that by stopping and not attempting to recover, proofs about protocol behavior and security properties are greatly simplified. This paper presents a...

We consider the problem of constructing a general protocol for secure two-party computation in a way that preserves security under concurrent composition. In our treatment, we focus on the case where an a-priori bound on the number of concurrent sessions is specified before the protocol is constructed (a.k.a. bounded concurrency). We make no set-up assumptions.
This paper presents a new bottom-up chart  parsing algorithm for Prolog along with  a compilation procedure that reduces the  amount of copying at run-time to a constant  number (2) per edge. It has applications  to unification-based grammars  with very large partially ordered categories,  in which copying is expensive,  and can facilitate the use of more sophisticated  indexing strategies for retrieving  such categories that may otherwise be  overwhelmed by the cost of such copying. It also provides

We determine the computational complexity of the problem of ordering a set of n numbers, either into a sequence or a cycle, such that the maximum sum of any k successive numbers is minimal. Both problems are easy for k = 2 and strongly NP-hard for any k  3. However, the two problems allow a polynomial-time approximation scheme that is linear in n.
We consider the problem of routing traffic to optimize the performance of a congested network. We are given a network, a rate of traffic between each pair of nodes, and a latency function for each edge specifying the time needed to traverse the edge given its congestion; the objective is to route traffic such that the sum of all travel times -- the total latency -- is minimized. In many settings,...
